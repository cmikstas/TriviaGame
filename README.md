# TriviaGame

What the project does?
I formatted this trivia game like after an AP US History exam. I thought it would be kinda funny and way to help me understand the array I had to build for the project. I went to AP History practice test sites, found questions, and changed them to bring in stuff from Terminator...

Why the project is useful
I'm not sure how useful this project is to anyone but me. This is the hardest code I've written to this point and probably spent ~20 hours on this project alone. This was super tough for me to finish. When people in class told me they were just starting this homework two days before it was due, my palms started to sweat. Unless they're really picking this stuff up, they're doomed!
